* Installation

** The manual way (NOT recommended)

   To install org-page manually you should first install all
   dependencies listed in *README.org*. Once this has been completed,
   clone the repo:

   : git clone https://github.com/kelvinh/org-page.it

   After that, please remember to add this location to your emacs'
   =load-path= variable so that emacs can find the package.

** Through package management system (strongly recommended)

   If you have never used emacs' package management system before,
   just add the following to your =init.el=:

   : (require 'package)
   : (package-initialize)
   : (add-to-list 'package-archives
   :              '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") t)

   Now you can install org-page using the following command:

   : M-x package-install org-page

* Configuration

  The *required configuration* of org-page is very simple, as shown below:

  : (add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/org-page")                    ;; only needed if you install org-page manually
  : (require 'org-page)
  : (setq op/repository-directory "path/to/your/org/repository")   ;; the repository location
  : (setq op/site-domain "http://your.personal.site.com/")         ;; your domain
  : ;;; the configuration below you should choose one, not both
  : (setq op/personal-disqus-shortname "your_disqus_shortname")    ;; your disqus commenting system
  : (setq op/personal-duoshuo-shortname "your_duoshuo_shortname")  ;; your duoshuo commenting system

* Publication

  You can re-publish all org source files, or just publish the files you modified since your last publication.

  To publish all files, evaluate the following line:

  : (op/do-publication t nil nil t)

  To publish files in your latest commit, evaluate the following line:

  : (op/do-publication)

  it is recommended to execute this command via =M-x= since you
  will see more detailed options.

** Site Preview

  If you'd like to preview your new post prior to publication, you can do this with

  : (op/do-publication-and-preview-site)

  After executing this command, your site will be published to the =op/site-preview-directory= which defaults to
  =~/.op-tmp= and will be served locally by [[https://github.com/skeeto/emacs-web-server][simple-httpd]]. The =op/site-preview-directory= variable is
  customizable. Be sure to read the documentation for =op/do-publication-and-preview-site= for even more options.

* Helpful features

  1. Do you find that initializing a repository manually is too much trouble?
     The =op/new-repository= command can simplify this.

  2. Want to make starting a post with essential properties much
     easier? Use the =op/new-post= command.

  3. Already in a post buffer and just want to insert essential
     properties? Use the =op/insert-options-template= command.

  4. Is the default slogan too ugly? Configure a better one (will be shown on each page):

     : (setq op/site-main-title "your main slogan")
     : (setq op/site-sub-title "your sub slogan")

  5. Is the branch you store org source files on not named "source"? It's
     easy to override the default branch names:

     : (setq op/repository-org-branch "your source branch name") ;; default is "source"
     : (setq op/repository-html-branch "your html branch name")  ;; default is "master"

  6. Have a github account? It's cool:

     : (setq op/personal-github-link "your github link")

  7. Want to do site traffic analytics with Google Analytics?

     : (setq op/personal-google-analytics-id "your google analytics id")

  8. Do you want to disable commenting for posts under certain
     categories? Yeah, it can be achieved:

     : (setq op/category-config-alist
     :       (cons '("photography" ;; category name goes here
     :               :show-comment nil)
     :             op/category-config-alist))

  9. Are there any other items that can be configured? Yeah, there are several:

     + =:show-meta=: show post meta info at the bottom of post?
     + =:uri-generator=: the function used to generate uri for posts
       under that category (however, it is not recommended to
       customize except you are an expert)
     + =:uri-template=: the template used to generate uri
     + =:sort-by=: how to sort posts on category index page, by
       =:date= or by =:mod-date=  (:mod-date is last modification date)?
     + =:category-index=: generate an index page for this category?
     + =:label=: displayed label for the category (default: category folder name)

  10. Want to add an avatar to the page?

     : (setq op/personal-avatar "URL to an image")

  11. Do not want to publish some categories?

     : (setq op/category-ignore-list '("category1" "category2"))

* Other configuration

  If you are looking for an option not described above, you can find a full
  list of configuration options by running =M-x customize-group= and then
  typing "=org-page=".
