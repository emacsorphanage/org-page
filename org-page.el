;; 2) incremental publication (according to =git diff= command)
;; 3) category support
;; 4) tags support (auto generated)
;; 5) RSS support (auto generated)
;; 6) search engine support (auto generated)
;; 7) a beautiful theme
;; 8) theme customization support
;; 9) commenting (implemented using disqus)
;; 10) site visiting tracking (implemented using google analytics)
;; 11) index/about page support (auto generated if no default provided)
;; 12) highly customizable

  "The main entrance of org-page. The entire procedure is:
1) verify configuration
2) read changed files on \"org branch\" of \"repository directory\",
   the definition of 'changed files' is:
1. if FORCE-ALL is non-nil, then all files will be published
will be published.
2. if FORCE-ALL is nil, the changed files will be obtained based on
BASE-GIT-COMMIT
3. if BASE-GIT-COMMIT is nil or omitted, the changed files will be obtained
based on previous commit
3) publish org files to html, if PUB-BASE-DIR is specified, use that directory
to store the generated html files, otherwise html files will be stored on \"html-branch\"
of \"repository directory\".
4) if PUB-BASE-DIR is nil, and AUTO-COMMIT is non-nil, then the changes stored
on \"html-branch\" will be automatically committed, but be careful, this feature is
NOT recommended, and a manual commit is much better
5) if PUB-BASE-DIR is nil, AUTO-COMMIT is non-nil, and AUTO-PUSH is non-nil,
then the \"html-branch\"  will be pushed to remote repo."
