;;; Commentary:

;; org-page.el contains the main entrance of entire program.
;;
;; This program can generate a complete static website based on
;; org-mode, with only a little configuration. It provides the following
;; features:
;;
;; + manage org source using git
;; + much more beautiful theme
;; + customized theme support
;; + tags support (auto generated)
;; + search engine support (auto generated)
;; + commenting (implemented using disqus)
;;
;; How it works:
;;
;; Read org file changes from the org source branch in the git repository,
;; and then publish the changes, to a directory if specified, or to the
;; html branch in that repository if no out directory specified.
;;
;; The minimal configuration that makes org-page work:
;;
;; 1. `op/repository-directory': the git repository directory, where your
;;    org files stored, and managed by git
;; 2. `op/site-url': the URL that search engine and disqus commenting will
;;    base on, it should be your personal site's URL
;; 3. `op/personal-disqus-shortname': the disqus shortname you own on
;;    disqus website, will be used for commenting
;;
;; Then, the following simple code will make org-page work:
;;
;;    (add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/org-page")
;;    (require 'org-page)
;;    (setq op/repository-directory "path/to/your/repo")
;;    (setq op/publish-site-url "http://your.personal.site.com/")
;;    (setq op/personal-disqus-shortname "your_disqus_shortname")
;;
;;    (op/do-publication)
;;
;; The code above makes it work, but, it does only "make it work", to
;; make org-page works as you want, maybe you need more configuration.
;; Please visit file `op-vars.el' for other variable configurations, and
;; visit description of `op/do-publication' for how org-page does the
;; publication and its parameter usage.

  "The main entrance of org-page. The entire procedure is:
1) verify configuration
2) read changed files on branch `op/repository-org-branch' of repository
`op/repository-directory', based on BASE-GIT-COMMIT, if it is omitted, will use
previous commit as the base commit.
3) publish org files to html, if PUB-BASE-DIR is specified, use that directory
to store the generated html files, otherwise html files will be stored on branch
`op/repository-html-branch' of repository `op/repository-directory'
4) if PUB-BASE-DIR is nil, and auto-commit is non-nil, then the changes stored
on branch `op/repository-html-branch' will be automatically committed, but be
careful, this feature is NOT recommended, and a manual commit is much better"
